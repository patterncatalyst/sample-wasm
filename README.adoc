Small sample application of Golang with WASM

Requirement:

Must have your GOPATH set even if using modules as wasm compilation will utilize it. e.g. $HOME/go
Must have your GOROOT set.  e.g. /usr/lib/go-<version number>

Compiling:

[source]
----
podman build -t wasm . 
----

NOTE: If your .config/containers/containers.conf registry is not set, it should let you select the registry and use the dockerhub registry entry.


Running:

[source]
----
podman run -d --name sample-wasm -p 8081:8080 localhost/wasm 
----

Testing:

[source]
----
curl http://localhost:8081
----

NOTE: Now run it in a browser and add numbers with http://localhost:8081
